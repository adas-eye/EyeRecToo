# EyeRecToo

EyeRecToo is a second-generation hardware-agnostic open-source software for
head-mounted eye trackers.  Its main raison d'Ãªtre is to provide an open
platform to replace the data acquisition functionality from eye-tracker
vendors' software, which typically are expensive, closed-source, and geared
toward their own devices.
It deprecates [EyeRec](https://www-ti.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/santini/EyeRec).

For data analysis functionality replacement, we recommend
[Eyetrace](http://www.ti.uni-tuebingen.de/Eyetrace.1751.0.html).

>*Why the name?*
>
>Originally, EyeRec was a phonetical play on words and the
>eye-related functionality as in **I rec**[ord].
>EyeRecToo adds on the word play: It is the version **two** and, similar to EyeRec, records **too**.
>All bad puns are intended :-)

## Supported Platforms

- Windows 64 bits
>This is the platform that gets the most testing and recommended.

- Initiall support for Ubuntu 16.04 64 bits has been added; no binaries available at the moment though.
>Only supports camera access using the uvcengine, including the Pupil Labs eye tracker. It has been tested for
pupil detection, gaze estimation, and data recording. This is **alpha**.

- Notes

>It's also possible to get EyeRecToo running on 32 bits platforms, but no Pupil
>eye tracker support is available.

## Supported Devices

Theoretically, cameras using DirectShow (on Windows) and v4l2 (on Linux)
should work out of the box.

UVC-compliant cameras are suuported through the [UVC Engine](https://atreus.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/santini/uvcengine).
On Windows, it is typically necessary to change camera drivers to be able to
use the uvcengine; see the **Running** section for details.

## Running

Binaries can be downloaded [here](https://www.hci.uni-tuebingen.de/research/Projects/eyerectoo.html).

**NOTE:** Additionally, you may need to install drivers to access your eye tracker
cameras:

1. Dikablis eye trackers require the
[VRMagic drivers](https://www.vrmagic.com/imaging/downloads/) (make sure you
have the 64 bits version)
2. For Pupil eye trackers, check the [Pupil Labs' guide](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/wiki/Windows-Driver-Setup).
3. (Windows only) for better interfacing with UVC-compliant cameras, we recommend to change the camera drivers to enable the uvcengine.
This can be easily achieved through [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/):
a) Check *Options->"list all devices"*,
b) uncheck *Options->"Ignore Hubs or Composite Parents"* ,
c) change your camera's *interface* driver to *libusbK*,
d) change your camera's *composite parent* to *libusbK*

## Developing

The official EyeRecToo repository is located at:
[https://atreus.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/santini/EyeRecToo](https://atreus.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/santini/EyeRecToo)

**Windows**

The particulars of the test build system we use are:
- QtCreator 4.0.3
- Qt >= 5.7.0 (MSVC 2015, 64 bit)
- Visual Studio 2015
- Microsoft Windows 8.1

All libraries/includes (for Windows 64 bits) should be in the deps directory already; to build:
1. Install Visual Studio 2015
2. Install Qt 5.7.0 (and Qt Creator)
3. Open the project
4. Run qmake and build
5. **Before running, add deps/runtime/Release or deps/runtime/Debug to your PATH accordingly to your build type.**

*Both Release and Debug versions are functional although the latter may run at much lower sampling rates.*

**Linux**

The particulars of the test build system we use are:
- QtCreator 4.4.1
- Qt 5.9.2
- GCC 5.4.0
- Ubuntu 16.04.3

Requires the installation of some packages (see README.LINUX); to build:
1. Install Qt 5.9.2 (and Qt Creator)
2. Run ./linux-setup.sh (or do the steps manually)
3. Open the project
4. Run qmake and build
5. Should be good to go :-)

## Data Format

Text data files (*.tsv*) use the [tsv format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) -- i.e., **tab** delimited files.

Video data files (*.mp4*) are uncompressed MJPEG files using MPEG-4 Part 14 containers.
**Note: timing information from these files is not reliable. You can find the timestamp for each frame in its respective *\*Data.tsv* counterpart.**

---

- *meta.csv*
>Contains meta data about the program, recording, and host machine.


- *\<Camera Widget\>Data.tsv* and *\<Camera Widget\>.mp4*
> Frames and respective processing tuples, e.g., detected pupil, markers, etc; these are FieldData and EyeData in the code. The number of entries in the *.tsv* **must** match the amount of frames in the video file. For each camera widget (e.g., eyes, field), one of these pairs is generated with the appropriate name -- e.g., RightEye.tsv, RightEye.mp4.

- *JournalData.tsv*
> Synchronized data file. This file includes entries containing only synchronized tuples (DataTuple in the code). **Note: despite gaze estimation being part of FieldData (since it's the correct reference frame), it is available only after synchronization and, thus, in this file, not on FieldData.tsv).**

- *[0-9]\*-calibration.tup*
> Data tuples used for calibration. The number prefix indicates the timestamp of the calibration.

---

For convenience, we also provide the *ERTViewer.exe* application, which allows one to visualize, do some basic annotation, and record gaze-overlayed videos from an EyeRecToo recording.

**Note:**
This is just a temporary application until we start integrating a data viewer/analyzer for video data in [*Eyetrace*](http://www.ti.uni-tuebingen.de/Eyetrace.1751.0.html). There are some bugs (e.g., the overlayed pupil can be slightly unsynchronized), and there is no focus on usability nor documentation.

## Markers

Default ArUco markers can be found under the *utils/all-markers* directory.

Default collection marker for *CalibMe* calibrations is provided at
*utils/CalibMeCollectionMarker.png*.

Camera calibration patterns are *utils/asymmetric_circle_grid_4x11_20mm.pdf* (default)
and *utils/chessboard_9x6_25mm.pdf*.

These markers can also be found only
[here](https://atreus.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/santini/EyeRecToo/tree/master/EyeRecToo/utils).

## Video Tutorials

An introduction to EyeRecToo is available on YouTube. It is a bit outdated since
its from 2017, but the principles remain the same.

If you want to learn more about *CalibMe* and unassisted calibration, here is a talk about it at CHI2017.

## Configuration Files

All configuration files are found in the *cfg* directory. These are
[*.ini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) files that can be easily edited
if needed.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

These shortcuts can be changed through *cfg/CommandManager.ini*. Key codes can
be found [here](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#Key-enum).

Exposed functionality at the moment includes:

- remoteCalibrationToggleKey = Qt::Key_PageDown:
> Toggles calibration (including *CalibMe* marker collection).

- calibrationToggleKey = Qt::Key_S:
> Toggles calibration.
 
- collectionToggleKey = Qt::Key_C:
> Toggles *CalibMe* marker collection.
 
- recordingToggleKey = Qt::Key_R:
> Toggles recording.

- remoteRecordingToggleKey = Qt::Key_PageUp:
> If subject is not set, sets subject to "remote". Toggles recording.

- previewToggleKey = Qt::Key_B:
> Freezes previews; useful, e.g., during development to check gaze estimation / pupil detection, or for didactic purposes.
